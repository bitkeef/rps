A simple Rock, Paper, Scissors implementation in HTML5

How to build/run
===

1. Make sure you have Node.js (NPM), Grunt and Bower installed on your machine.
2. Clone the repo locally
3. Run `npm install` from the root directory to download the Grunt dependencies
4. Run `bower install` from the root directory to download the Bower dependencies
5. Run `bower install` from the `test/` directory to download the Bower dependencies for tests

You can now run the default `grunt` command from the root directory which will build the app and set up watch tasks.

To preview the app, run `grunt serve` to view the app in a browser (includes live reload for quicker development).
